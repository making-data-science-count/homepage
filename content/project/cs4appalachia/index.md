[CS for Appalachia: A Research-Practice Partnership for Integrating Computer Science into East Tennessee Schools](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923509&HistoricalAwards=false) is a two-year project led by Lynn Hodge, STEM education professor. The project is focused on developing a research-practice partnership among researchers, teachers and administrators to address challenges related to teaching computer science at the elementary level. Building upon the shared vision developed within the research-practice partnership, the $250,000 grant includes opportunities for K-5 teachers to engage in professional development about the Tennessee computer science standards.

This project is related to the project *Planting the seeds for computer science education in East Tennessee through a research-practice partnership*, which was 
funded through the [University of Tennessee's Community Engaged Research Seed Program](https://research.utk.edu/2019-research-seed-program-recipients/).
