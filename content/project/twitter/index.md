title: 'Policy and networks on Twitter'
---

This work is centered around two ongoing projects.

One is supported by Visiting Faculty Travel Grant Program funding from the Southeastern Conference to collaborate with [Annelise Russell](https://www.anneliserussell.me/) and Spencer Greenhalgh at the University of Kentucky around how the broader policy environment may impact 
state-based Twitter hashtags (see [Rosenberg et al., 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2042753016672351)).

A second concerns how the use of the #NGSSchat hashtag may have implications for 
how the new science standards are taken up and implemented across the United States (see [Rosenberg et al., 2019](https://osf.io/uwza6/)).
