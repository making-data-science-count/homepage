&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua M. Rosenberg (PhD, Michigan State University) is an Assistant Professor of STEM Education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research focuses on how learners think of and with data, particularly in science education settings. Dr. Rosenberg tries to understand how practices such as creating, representing, and modeling data create new opportunities for learning how to use data to pose and answer questions about scientific phenomena. In addition to how learners think of and with data, Dr. Rosenberg is also interested in student engagement across a range of STEM learning environments and the use of technology in education, particularly for teacher professional development. As a part of this work, Dr. Rosenberg makes use of quantitative methods, such as multi-level models for analyzing data collected through the experience sampling method, and newer approaches, such as social network analysis to analyze teachers’ conversations on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosenberg teaches classes in science and STEM education, educational technology, and research methods. In his classes, Dr. Rosenberg aims to involve students in authentic practices from the field of study. For example, in teacher education classes, this plays out through giving students opportunities to both participate in as well as plan and enact activities focused upon engaging in scientific and engineering practices. In graduate-level classes, Dr. Rosenberg focuses on scholarly practices, particularly critiquing and contributing to ongoing conversations about educational policy and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alex Lishinski (PhD, Michigan State University) is a postdoctoral education researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research is mostly in the field of computer science education, focusing on motivation-related constructs. Dr. Lishinski is especially interested in the unique motivational and emotional difficulties faced by students learning programming and computational thinking skills for the first time. Dr. Lishinski is also interested in developing measures and measurement approaches to investigate the more fine-grained aspects of students&amp;rsquo; motivational and emotional experiences during the learning process. Dr. Lishinski&amp;rsquo;s work primarily makes use of quantitative methods such as structural equation modeling, item response theory, and hierarchical linear models.&lt;/p&gt;
