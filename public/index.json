[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Biography Joshua M. Rosenberg (PhD, Michigan State University) is an Assistant Professor of STEM Education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research focuses on how learners think of and with data, particularly in science education settings. Dr. Rosenberg tries to understand how practices such as creating, representing, and modeling data create new opportunities for learning how to use data to pose and answer questions about scientific phenomena. In addition to how learners think of and with data, Dr. Rosenberg is also interested in student engagement across a range of STEM learning environments and the use of technology in education, particularly for teacher professional development. As a part of this work, Dr. Rosenberg makes use of quantitative methods, such as multi-level models for analyzing data collected through the experience sampling method, and newer approaches, such as social network analysis to analyze teachers’ conversations on social media.\nDr. Rosenberg teaches classes in science and STEM education, educational technology, and research methods. In his classes, Dr. Rosenberg aims to involve students in authentic practices from the field of study. For example, in teacher education classes, this plays out through giving students opportunities to both participate in as well as plan and enact activities focused upon engaging in scientific and engineering practices. In graduate-level classes, Dr. Rosenberg focuses on scholarly practices, particularly critiquing and contributing to ongoing conversations about educational policy and practice.\nLinks Personal Homepage: https://joshuamrosenberg.com\nVita: http://jmichaelrosenberg.com/rosenberg-cv.pdf\n","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Biography Joshua M.

Rosenberg’s dissertation research utilized an experience sampling method in which study participants were surveyed with short questions delivered via cell phones at regular intervals throughout the course of their learning during out-of-school summer STEM programs. This project uses a similar methodological approach in an undergraduate context.

The project is focused on developing a research-practice partnership among researchers, teachers and administrators to address challenges related to teaching computer science at the elementary level. Building upon the shared vision developed within the research-practice partnership, the $250,000 grant includes opportunities for K-5 teachers to engage in professional development about the Tennessee computer science standards.\nAdvancing Computational Grounded Theory for Audiovisual Data from STEM Classrooms is a three-year collaborative project among faculty at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU); and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The project is led by Christina Krist, UIUC assistant professor of curriculum and instruction. This project is focused on developing a new research methodology that uniquely combines two approaches: interpretative human-driven coding and newer machine learning techniques, also known as artificial intelligence.

Rich multi-method data sets will be used to develop profiles of student engagement involving adolescents\u0026rsquo; cognitive, affective, and behavioral states during the science learning process. These data will be instrumental in focusing, guiding, and communicating research efforts to practice. In addition to the knowledge generated and disseminated through traditional academic outlets, the project will develop two tangible products. The first product will be a free and publicly available statistical software library, or package, of tools and functions needed to conduct person-oriented analysis in R, the open-source programming language and software. These tools will be available for researchers, scholars, and developers. The second product will be a user-friendly guide that will inform science educators about engagement profiles and practices that engage students, including those from underrepresented groups in science, in the most meaningful ways. The guide to student engagement will help educators identify and respond to student engagement around science content, and to design lesson plans that may support greater engagement. The guide will be used for purposes of professional development and teacher preparation, impacting STEM scholars and educators, and training graduate students and post-doctoral fellow as they take part in research activities.\n Rosenberg led to development of the tidyLPA software used for this project and is a consultant for this project.\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"d66ce715cf320e2565a008717079d1f2","permalink":"/project/pse/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pse/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the nature of student engagement in science","tags":["Science Education"],"title":"Profiles of science engagement","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sparked by a collaboration with Bodong Chen, this is a project with Alex Edwards, a 7th-grade science teacherat Tate\u0026rsquo;s School We recently wrote about some of the take-aways from our work last year in a publication on “Tools and strategies for engaging students in analyzing and interpreting complex data sources.” The article is going to be published in NSTA’s The Science Teacher journal (a pre-print of the article is [here]https://www.makingdatasciencecount.com/publication/2019-tst/).\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"1b1df647400df3af9d177ef6711ae4d1","permalink":"/project/ms-data-sci/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ms-data-sci/","section":"project","summary":"Data science in middle school science classrooms","tags":["Science Education","Data Science Education"],"title":"Using R with 7th-grade science students","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
