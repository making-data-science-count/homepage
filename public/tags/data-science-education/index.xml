      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920796&amp;amp;HistoricalAwards=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advancing Computational Grounded Theory for Audiovisual Data from STEM Classrooms&lt;/a&gt; is a three-year collaborative project among faculty at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU); and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The project is led by Christina Krist, UIUC assistant professor of curriculum and instruction. This project is focused on developing a new research methodology that uniquely combines two approaches: interpretative human-driven coding and newer machine learning techniques, also known as artificial intelligence. The aim is to use audio-visual data from STEM classrooms to study the kinds of teaching and learning of most interest to educational researchers rather than simply what can be studied using machine learning.The $1.3 million dollar grant will support a postdoctoral scholar at MTSU and graduate research assistants at UIUC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Science in Education Using R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Data Science in Education Using R&amp;rsquo; by Emily A. Bovee, Ryan A. Estrellado, Jesse Mostipak, Joshua M. Rosenberg, and Isabella C. VelaÃÅsquez to be published by Routledge in 2020. The book is being written in the open through GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Policy and networks on Twitter</title>
      <link>/project/twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/twitter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work is centered around two ongoing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is supported by Visiting Faculty Travel Grant Program funding from the Southeastern Conference to collaborate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anneliserussell.me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Annelise Russell&lt;/a&gt; and Spencer Greenhalgh at the University of Kentucky around how the broader policy environment may impact
state-based Twitter hashtags (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2042753016672351&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rosenberg et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second concerns how the use of the #NGSSchat hashtag may have implications for
how the new science standards are taken up and implemented across the United States (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/uwza6/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rosenberg et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related project with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.education.udel.edu/faculty-bio/teomara-rutherford/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Teya Rutherford&lt;/a&gt; aims to understand how individuals&amp;rsquo; gender relates to how they interact with others (and are interacted with) as well as how individuals experience being gendered on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collaboration led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-and-research/directories/a-z/profile/?id=221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stephen Aguilar&lt;/a&gt; explores how beginning mathematics teachers use Twitter (and other social media platforms) to seek out resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/tidytuesday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An ongoing project is an analysis of [#tidytuesday[(&lt;a href=&#34;https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A repository with material for this project is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/acircleda/TidyTuesday-Analysis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/acircleda/TidyTuesday-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
