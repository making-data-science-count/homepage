      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920796&amp;amp;HistoricalAwards=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advancing Computational Grounded Theory for Audiovisual Data from STEM Classrooms&lt;/a&gt; is a three-year collaborative project among faculty at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU); and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The project is led by Christina Krist, UIUC assistant professor of curriculum and instruction. This project is focused on developing a new research methodology that uniquely combines two approaches: interpretative human-driven coding and newer machine learning techniques, also known as artificial intelligence. The aim is to use audio-visual data from STEM classrooms to study the kinds of teaching and learning of most interest to educational researchers rather than simply what can be studied using machine learning.The $1.3 million dollar grant will support a postdoctoral scholar at MTSU and graduate research assistants at UIUC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923509&amp;amp;HistoricalAwards=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CS for Appalachia: A Research-Practice Partnership for Integrating Computer Science into East Tennessee Schools&lt;/a&gt; is a two-year project led by Lynn Hodge, STEM education professor. The project is focused on developing a research-practice partnership among researchers, teachers and administrators to address challenges related to teaching computer science at the elementary level. Building upon the shared vision developed within the research-practice partnership, the $250,000 grant includes opportunities for K-5 teachers to engage in professional development about the Tennessee computer science standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is related to the project &lt;em&gt;Planting the seeds for computer science education in East Tennessee through a research-practice partnership&lt;/em&gt;, which was
funded through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.utk.edu/2019-research-seed-program-recipients/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;University of Tennessee&amp;rsquo;s Community Engaged Research Seed Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
